    "Domain –Telecomfocus –OptimizationBusiness challenge/requirementLifeTel Telecomis the latest entrant in the highly competitive Telecom market of Singapore.  It issues SIM to the verified users. Till now verification was manual through the photocopy of the approved id card document. However,the government has recently introduced a Social ID called Reference ID which is mapped to the fingerprint of the user. LifeTelshould now verify the user against the fingerprint a Reference ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key issues: Build a system where when a user enters Reference ID it is encryptedso that hackers cannot view the mapping of Reference ID and fingerprintConsiderationsThe systemshould be secureData volume-NAAdditional information-NABusiness benefitsThe companywill be able to quickly issue SIM to the user and the expected gain in volume is approximately 10 times as the manual process of verification is replaced with a secure automated systemApproach to Solve. You must use the fundamentals of Python taught in module 1. \n",
